## Summary
I have a solid foundation in IT infrastructure, cloud computing (Azure, AWS), and   technical support. As a member of the Selwyn Youth Council, I collaborate with local youth initiatives to drive community improvements. My hands-on experience with Microsoft 365, Intune, video production, and leadership skills equips me for a career in IT technical support and cloud administration. In late 2023, I joined the Lincoln Ventures where I gain valuable people skills and experience in activities like camping, and tramping.
